# nodejs_apis

### This is the very basic idea of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in nodejs using express and CRUD in mongoDB.
A starter for beginners and can also be used as a boilerplate for routes and apis. You can add similar multiple routes by just exporting them from the index of the "routes" folder.

#### To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create an account on "mongoDb atlas" here: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas.
3. Follow the steps on the same to make a new cluster and get the url to connect to the database.
4. Put the url in the location : config/db.js.
5. Run the code using either "npm start" or "node server.js".
6. Use "postman" to hit the apis that are exposed from the "example_route".
